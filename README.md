# portfollio-website-01
A clean, minimalist portfolio website.

This project is primarily intended to showcase a software developer's skills and personal projects, although it can certainly be utilized as a portfolio hub for many other professionals.

I plan to use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for this build - additional tools will be utilized if/when the need arises.
